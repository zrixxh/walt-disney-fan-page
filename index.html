      Walt Disney, born December 5, 1901, in Chicago, Illinois, grew up in Kansas City and began showing artistic talent early in life. By his teenage years, he joined the Red Cross during World War I, using forged documents due to his age. After returning home, he studied at the Kansas City Art Institute, where he met his lifelong collaborator, Ub Iwerks.

      Together, Walt and Ub formed a small animation company that eventually went bankrupt, prompting their move to Hollywood in 1923. There, they launched the "Alice Comedies" series with modest backing from distributor Margaret Winkler and Walt’s brother Roy. When this series ended, Walt introduced Oswald the Lucky Rabbit—but lost the character due to a contract loophole.

      On a train ride home, Walt sketched a cheerful mouse that became Mickey Mouse. His third Mickey cartoon, <em>Steamboat Willie</em> (1928), revolutionized animation by synchronizing sound with action. From there, Disney became a household name.

      His creative breakthroughs continued with the "Silly Symphonies," and in 1937, he released the first full-length animated feature, <em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</em>. It was a critical and commercial success that silenced skeptics.

      Over the next two decades, Walt brought beloved films like <em>Pinocchio</em>, <em>Bambi</em>, and <em>Peter Pan</em> to life. He expanded into live-action film and television and unveiled Disneyland in 1955—an immersive park designed to bring imagination to reality.

      His crowning achievement, <em>Mary Poppins</em> (1964), was a blend of live-action and animation. Even in his final years, Walt dreamed of a futuristic city called EPCOT. Sadly, he passed away on December 15, 1966, from complications of lung cancer. But his legacy lives on through the global success of The Walt Disney Company.
